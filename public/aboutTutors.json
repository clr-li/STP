    "bio": "Born in Denmark, Alex shares his birth country's values of accessible education and free thinking. During his high school years, he volunteered with local Elementary Schools in the Seattle Area to make music education freely accessible. He has since expanded to more subject areas to share his philosophy of combining learning styles (visual, tactile, explanations, examples) to develop understanding of why patterns form rather than blindly memorizing how they work. This philosophy has guided his own learning as he explored his own passion for Math and Science when he was younger through books and experiments. His understanding later fascillitated him enjoying Science Olympiad, Data Science internships, and research opportunities with Professor Richard at UW.",
